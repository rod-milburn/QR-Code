### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned

I learned how to manipulate the items by cenering the project horizontal and vertical. I need to review some of the css properties in a more practical way instead of guessing what the CSS property does to the HTML Mark up. There is need to plan out the challenge instead of diving into coding.



```
```css
.proud-of-this-css body{
    background-color: #d3d3d3;
    display:flex;
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content:center;
  }
### Continued development

I am still not completly comfortable of using CSS to its capabilities, such of using the class and properties to move, change the HTML item.



### Useful resources

(https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php) 
W3 schools helped me on how position QR code vertically and horizontal.
